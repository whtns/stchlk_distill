abstract = {Single-cell sequencing is emerging as a critical technology for understanding the biology of cancer, neurons, and other complex systems. Here we introduce Ginkgo, a web platform for the interactive analysis and quality assessment of single-cell copy-number alterations. Ginkgo fully automates the process of binning, normalizing, and segmenting mapped reads to infer copy number profiles of individual cells, as well as constructing phylogenetic trees of how those cells are related. We validate Ginkgo by reproducing the results of five major single-cell studies, and discuss how it addresses the wide array of biases that affect single-cell analysis. We also examine the data characteristics of three commonly used single-cell amplification techniques: MDA, MALBAC, and DOP-PCR/WGA4 through comparative analysis of 9 different single-cell datasets. We conclude that DOP-PCR provides the most uniform amplification, while MDA introduces substantial biases into the analysis. Furthermore, given the same level of coverage, our results indicate that data prepared using DOP-PCR can reliably call CNVs at higher resolution than data prepared using either MALBAC or MDA. Ginkgo is freely available at http://qb.cshl.edu/ginkgo.},

abstract = {Genome-wide analysis at the level of single cells has recently emerged as a powerful tool to dissect genome heterogeneity in cancer, neurobiology, and development. To be truly transformative, single-cell approaches must affordably accommodate large numbers of single cells. This is feasible in the case of copy number variation (CNV), because CNV determination requires only sparse sequence coverage. We have used a combination of bioinformatic and molecular approaches to optimize single-cell DNA amplification and library preparation for highly multiplexed sequencing, yielding a method that can produce genome-wide CNV profiles of up to a hundred individual cells on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq instrument. We apply the method to human cancer cell lines and biopsied cancer tissue, thereby illustrating its efficiency, reproducibility, and power to reveal underlying genetic heterogeneity and clonal phylogeny. The capacity of the method to facilitate the rapid profiling of hundreds to thousands of single-cell genomes represents a key step in making single-cell profiling an easily accessible tool for studying cell lineage.},

abstract = {Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer often associated with poor patient outcome and resistance to targeted therapy. Assessment of genomic instability in bulk tumor or biopsy can be complicated due to sample availability, surrounding tissue contamination, or tumor heterogeneity. The Epic Sciences circulating tumor cell (CTC) platform utilizes a non-enrichment based approach for the detection and characterization of rare tumor cells in clinical blood samples. Genomic profiling of individual CTCs could provide a portrait of cancer heterogeneity, identify clonal and sub-clonal drivers, and monitor disease progression. To that end, we developed a single cell Copy Number Variation (CNV) Assay to evaluate genomic instability and CNVs in patient CTCs. For proof of concept, prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC3 and VCaP, were spiked into healthy donor blood to create mock patient-like samples for downstream single cell genomic analysis. In addition, samples from seven metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were included to evaluate clinical feasibility. CTCs were enumerated and characterized using the Epic Sciences CTC Platform. Identified single CTCs were recovered, whole genome amplified, and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500. CTCs were then analyzed for genome-wide copy number variations, followed by genomic instability analyses. Large-scale state transitions (LSTs) were measured as surrogates of genomic instability. Genomic instability scores were determined reproducibly for LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP, and were higher than white blood cell (WBC) controls from healthy donors. A wide range of LST scores were observed within and among the seven mCRPC patient samples. On the gene level, loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor was observed in PC3 and 5/7 (71{\%}) patients. Amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was observed in VCaP cells and 5/7 (71{\%}) mCRPC patients. Using an in silico down-sampling approach, we determined that DNA copy number and genomic instability can be detected with as few as 350K sequencing reads. The data shown here demonstrate the feasibility of detecting genomic instabilities at the single cell level using the Epic Sciences CTC Platform. Understanding CTC heterogeneity has great potential for patient stratification prior to treatment with targeted therapies and for monitoring disease evolution during treatment.},

abstract = {Motivation Current technologies for single-cell DNA sequencing require whole-genome amplification (WGA), as a single cell contains too little DNA for direct sequencing. Unfortunately, WGA introduces biases in the resulting sequencing data, including non-uniformity in genome coverage and high rates of allele dropout. These biases complicate many downstream analyses, including the detection of genomic variants. Results We show that amplification biases have a potential upside: long-range correlations in rates of allele dropout provide a signal for phasing haplotypes at the lengths of amplicons from WGA, lengths which are generally longer than than individual sequence reads. We describe a statistical test to measure concurrent allele dropout between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across multiple sequenced single cells. We use results of this test to perform haplotype assembly across a collection of single cells. We demonstrate that the algorithm predicts phasing between pairs of SNPs with higher accuracy than phasing from reads alone. Using whole-genome sequencing data from only seven neural cells, we obtain haplotype blocks that are orders of magnitude longer than with sequence reads alone (median length 10.2 kb versus 312 bp), with error rates {\textless}2{\%}. We demonstrate similar advantages on whole-exome data from 16 cells, where we obtain haplotype blocks with median length 9.2 kb-comparable to typical gene lengths-compared with median lengths of 41 bp with sequence reads alone, with error rates {\textless}4{\%}. Our algorithm will be useful for haplotyping of rare alleles and studies of allele-specific somatic aberrations.

We use an iterative method to resolve the halos at small scattering angles from the zeroth order data in CC-mode or the first order data in TE-mode which is not or less piled-up. Using the halo models of Weingartner {\$}{\&}{\$} Draine (2001, WD01) and Mathis, Rumpl {\$}{\&}{\$} Nordsieck (1977, MRN) to fit the halo profiles, we get the hydrogen column densities and the spatial distributions of the scattering dust grains along the line of sights (LOS) to these sources. We find that the scattering dust density very close to these sources is much higher than the normal interstellar medium. For X-ray pulsars GX 301-2 and Vela X-1 with companions of strong stellar winds, the X-ray absorption column densities are much higher than the derived scattering column densities, because of the dense media around the X-ray sources produce extremely small angle scatterings which are indistinguishable from the point sources even with $\backslash$textit{\{}Chandra{\}}'s angular resolution. For LMC X-1, most of the scattering and absorption occur in Large Magellanic Cloud, rather than in the Milky Way. From the obtained X-rays spectra, the cold gas absorption and thus the quivalent hydrogen column is determined. We have obtained the linear correlation between {\$}N{\_}{\{}H{\}}{\$} derived from spectral fits and the one derived from the halo model WD01 and MRN (except for GX 301-2 and Vela X-1): {\$}N{\_}{\{}H,WD01{\}} = (0.720\backslashpm0.009) \backslashtimes N{\_}{\{}H,abs{\}} + (0.051\backslashpm0.013){\$} and {\$}N{\_}{\{}N, MRN{\}} = (1.156\backslashpm0.016) \backslashtimes N{\_}{\{}H,abs{\}} + (0.062\backslashpm0.024){\$} in the units {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}22{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}.

We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We develop a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship.},

In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosome instability leads to aneuploidy, a state in which cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, and is found in two out of three cancers. In a chromosomal instable p53 deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that chromosome instability is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing chromosome instability. Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our data show that even though aneuploid tumours select for particular and recurring chromosome combinations, single-cell analysis using AneuFinder reveals copy number heterogeneity. This suggests ongoing chromosome instability that other platforms fail to detect. As chromosome instability might drive tumour evolution, karyotype analysis using single-cell sequencing technology could become an essential tool for cancer treatment stratification.},

abstract = {Human cancers, including breast cancers, comprise clones differing in mutation content. Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of Darwinian evolution, underpinning important emergent features such as drug resistance and metastasis. Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating tumours. However, the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on the genomic clonal architecture of tumours have not been systematically examined at single-cell resolution. Here we show, using deep-genome and single-cell sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from extreme selective engraftment of minor ({\textless}5{\%} of starting population) clones to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature of tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single-cell sequencing, we show that major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal population dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies using patient-derived breast cancer xenoengraftment.},

In addition, the adenoma and cancer further developed intratumor heterogeneity with the accumulation of nonrandom somatic mutations specifically in GPCR, PI3K-Akt and FGFR signaling pathways. We identified novel driver mutations that developed during adenoma and cancer evolution, particularly in OR1B1 (GPCR signaling pathway) for adenoma evolution, and LAMA1 (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) and ADCY3 (FGFR signaling pathway) for CRC evolution. In summary, we demonstrated that both colorectal adenoma and CRC are monoclonal in origin, and the CRCs further diversified into different subclones with heterogeneous mutation profiles accumulating in GPCR, PI3K-Akt and FGFR signaling pathways. ScWES provides evidence for the importance of mutations in certain pathways that would not be as apparent from bulk sequencing of tumors, and can potentially establish whether specific mutations are mutually exclusive or occur sequentially in the same subclone of cells.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 December 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.438.},
