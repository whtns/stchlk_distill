I presented at our weekly lab meeting last Friday and described our experiences with Seurat on our single cell data. 

We have two projects ongoing: 

- Transcriptional Response to Rb Loss in the Retinoblastoma Cell of Origin
  Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq)

- Changes associated with retinal cone precursor development
  Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq)
  
I tried to cover:

1. Our initial approaches to analyzing single cell data and why they fell short.
2. How we applied Seurat and what advantages it has offered.
3. Other ways forward with similar mature single cell analysis tools.
